## 🎯 Purpose

This repository serves as:

- **Educational Resource**: Learn DSA concepts through practical implementations
- **Multi-language Reference**: Compare implementations across C and Python
- **Practice Ground**: Exercises and experimentation space to reinforce learning
- **Theoretical Foundation**: Language-agnostic documentation on Abstract Data Types

## 🔬 Learning & Experimentation

### 🎮 Playground Directory

The `Python/playground/` directory is your dedicated space for **experimentation and learning**.

It will be ignored by git as it is in the `.gitignore`

Feel free to:

- Test modifications to existing data structures
- Try out new algorithms and approaches
- Practice problem-solving techniques
- Experiment with different implementations
- Break things and learn from mistakes!

**Why use the playground?**

- ✅ Already in `.gitignore` - your experiments stay local
- ✅ Safe space to make mistakes without affecting main codebase
- ✅ Perfect for following tutorials or testing ideas
- ✅ Encourages hands-on learning

### Study Approach

1. **Read the Docs**: Start with theoretical concepts in `Docs/`
2. **Examine Code**: Study the implementations in your preferred language
3. **Run Examples**: Execute the code to see data structures in action
4. **Try Exercises**: Test your understanding with provided exercises
5. **Experiment**: Use the playground to practice and explore

## 📚 Documentation Overview

The `Docs/` directory contains comprehensive theoretical coverage:

### Linear Data Structures

- **Arrays**: Dynamic arrays, operations, complexity analysis
- **Linked Lists**: Singly/doubly linked lists, traversal, applications
- **Stacks**: LIFO principle, implementations, use cases
- **Queues**: FIFO principle, circular queues, priority queues

### Non-Linear Data Structures

- **Trees**: Binary trees, BSTs, traversal algorithms
- **Heaps**: Min/max heaps, heap operations, applications
- **Hashmaps**: Hashing techniques, collision resolution
- **Graphs**: Representations, traversal algorithms
- **Advanced Trees**: Red-Black trees, balancing operations

### Planning Resources

- **Roadmap**: Learning path and progression guide
- **Checklist**: Track your learning progress
- **Projects**: Practical project ideas to apply DSA knowledge
