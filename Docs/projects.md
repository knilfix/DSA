# ✅ Phase 0

## Linear Data Structures Projects

> Purpose: turn arrays, linked lists, queues, stacks, and hashmaps into useful real tools

### Arrays + Dynamic Arrays

- Project A1: Dynamic Array CLI (push, pop, insert, delete, print)
- Project A2: Stats Tool (min/max/avg/median search)

### Singly Linked List

- Project L1: Playlist Manager (add/remove/search tracks)
- Project L2: Reverse + loop detection tests

### Doubly Linked List

- Project L3: Browser Tabs Navigation (back/forward)
- Project L4: Deque data type using DLL

### Stacks

- Project S1: Expression Validator (matching parentheses)
- Project S2: Undo/Redo system using two stacks

### Queues

- Project Q1: Customer Service Simulation (enqueue/dequeue + waiting time)
- Project Q2: Round-robin CPU Scheduler simulation

### Hashmaps (your latest beast)

- Project H1: Key-Value Store CLI (put/get/remove/resize stats)
- Project H2: Frequency Counter CLI (top N repeated words from text file)
