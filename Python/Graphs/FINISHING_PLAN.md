# Graph Implementation Finishing Plan

## Priority 1: Must Finish (Interview Essential)

- [x] graph.py - Adjacency list/matrix implementation
- [ ] dfs.py - Depth First Search (recursive + iterative)
- [ ] bfs.py - Breadth First Search
- [ ] topological_sort.py - For DAGs (dependency problems)
- [ ] dijkstra.py - Shortest path (weighted graphs, no negative edges)
- [ ] prims.py - Minimum Spanning Tree (choose Prim's OR Kruskal's)
- [ ] exercises.md - Practice problems

## Priority 2: If Time Permits

- [ ] Trie basics (just construction + search)
- [ ] More graph exercises

## Save for Later

- Bellman-Ford (negative weight edges)
- Kruskal's (if you did Prim's)
- Floyd-Warshall
- Advanced trie operations
- A* pathfinding

## Notes

- DFS/BFS are CRITICAL - practice both approaches
- Topological sort comes up in scheduling/dependency problems
- Dijkstra is the most common shortest path in interviews
- One MST algorithm is enough (Prim's is simpler to code)
