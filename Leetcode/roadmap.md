## 🎯 DAILY PRACTICE STRATEGY

### **4-Hour DSA Block Breakdown:**

**Session 1-2 (1 hour): Problem Solving**

- Pick 1-2 problems from current week
- 30 min: Attempt without hints
- 15 min: Review solution if stuck
- 15 min: Implement and test

**Session 3-4 (1 hour): Deep Dive**

- Understand WHY solution works
- Try alternate approaches
- Analyze time/space complexity
- Write out explanation in own words

**Session 5-6 (1 hour): Lord of Algorithms App**

- Related puzzles to reinforce
- Visual understanding
- Pattern recognition
- Make it FUN

**Session 7-8 (1 hour): Review or Project**

- Revisit problems from previous days
- Or work on portfolio projects
- Or contribute to open source

---

## 📊 TRACKING YOUR PROGRESS

### **Weekly Goals:**

```
Week 1-4:   12-13 Easy problems/week
Week 5-8:   12-13 Medium problems/week
Week 9-12:  12-13 Medium problems/week
Week 13-16: 12-13 Medium+Hard/week
Week 17-20: 12-13 Mixed/week
```

### **Monthly Checkpoints:**

```
End of Month 1: 50 Easy solved, confidence ✓
End of Month 2: 100 total, Medium comfort growing
End of Month 3: 150 total, patterns clicking
End of Month 4: 200 total, Hard attempts ongoing
End of Month 5: 250+ total, interview-ready
```

---

## 🎮 INTEGRATION WITH APP

### **Use Lord of Algorithms for:**

- Visual reinforcement after solving tree problems
- Graph algorithm animations (BFS/DFS visualization)
- Breaking mental blocks (switch to puzzle mode)
- Pattern recognition through gameplay
- Keeping DSA fun during grind

### **Schedule:**

```
LeetCode: 2 hours (structured learning)
App: 1 hour (fun reinforcement)
Projects: 1 hour (application)
```

---

## ⚡ POWER TIPS

### **1. Solve Problems in Clusters**

Don't random pick - do all "linked list reversal" problems together. Pattern recognition emerges faster.

### **2. Revisit After 1 Week**

Spaced repetition works. If you solved problem on Monday, try again next Monday without looking.

### **3. Explain Out Loud**

Pretend you're in an interview. Talk through your approach. This is 50% of the interview.

### **4. Track Patterns, Not Just Problems**

```
"I've done 20 tree problems" ❌
"I've mastered DFS, BFS, BST validation" ✅
```

### **5. Use the App When Stuck**

LeetCode feels hard? Switch to app for 30 min. Come back refreshed.

---

## 🚀 YOUR ADVANTAGES

**With your background, these will be EASY:**

- All linked list problems (you built them in C)
- All stack/queue problems (you know LIFO/FIFO cold)
- Tree traversals (you've done them recursively AND iteratively)
- BST problems (you understand the invariant)
- Rotations (RB-Tree experience)

**These will click FAST:**

- Graph traversals (same as tree traversals)
- Two pointers (logical thinking like in C)
- Design problems (systems thinking)

**These will take practice:**

- DP (pattern recognition over time)
- Backtracking (recursion comfort helps)
- String manipulation (less foundational, more tricks)
